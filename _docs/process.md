- Tasks are GitHub issues, one at a time
- Read the acceptance criteria before starting and before closing
- Commit regularly

Labels

- `mvp` - needed for the current minimum viable product
- `post-mvp` - real work, deliberately deferred
- Every issue carries exactly one of the two above labels

Roles

- PM - grooms a task before anyone implements it, follows _docs/team/pm.md
- Engineer - implements one groomed task, follows _docs/team/software-engineer.md
- QA - checks the result, reports PASS or FAIL, and comments on FAIL; follows _docs/team/qa-engineer.md

Orchestrator

The main session is the orchestrator. It launches the PM, the engineer
and QA as subagents. It follows _docs/team/orchestrator.md and does not groom,
implement or test itself.

Lifecycle

1. Pick the next open issue from the backlog
2. PM grooms it
3. Engineer implements it
4. QA verifies it
5. On FAIL, back to step 3 with the QA comment as input
6. On PASS, close the issue
7. Repeat until the backlog is empty

Rules

- Do not skip step 2
- The engineer does not close the issue
- QA does not fix the code, only outputs PASS or FAIL
- The orchestrator closes the issue only after QA outputs PASS
